# ArcherPhish
This is a demo/research project intended to aid in the understanding of advanced phishing attacks used by adversaries, based upon the preliminary research/notes in this microsoft article: https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/07/12/from-cookie-theft-to-bec-attackers-use-aitm-phishing-sites-as-entry-point-to-further-financial-fraud/

Currently, this project is capable of intercepting plain HTTP traffic, however the replication of full remote sites is not entirely possible due to issues with SSL, and parsing remote CSS/JS files that are in use by remote webservers
